Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/). This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf), which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

The Goal is to clean and store the data the bank collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like you to set up a MongoDB database to store this campaign's data, in a way that would allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported. 

The result of the campaign is a csv file called `"bank_marketing.csv"`, which needs to be cleaned, reformated, and splited, in order to save separate files based on the tables you will create. 

I will write the code that the bank can execute to create the tables and populate with the data from the csv files. 
Also I will write tests for the functions to connect to the MongoDB database
Its important to mention that this version connects to a local MongoDB enviroment. Its possible to connect to a server or even to the cloud aka Atlas using, for example, a enviroment variable to hide the password

The database must have three tables as the following schemas shows:

## client

| column | data type | description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `id` | `serial` | Client ID - primary key |
| `age` | `integer` | Client's age in years |
| `job` | `text` | Client's type of job |
| `marital` | `text` | Client's marital status |
| `education` | `text` | Client's level of education |
| `credit_default` | `boolean` | Whether the client's credit is in default |
| `housing` | `boolean` | Whether the client has an existing housing loan (mortgage) |
| `loan` | `boolean` | Whether the client has an existing personal loan |

## campaign

| column | data type | description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `campaign_id` | `serial` | Campaign ID - primary key |
| `client_id` | `serial` | Client ID - references `id` in the `client` table |
| `number_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the current campaign |
| `contact_duration` | `integer` | Last contact duration in seconds |
| `pdays` | `integer` | Number of days since contact in previous campaign (`999` = not previously contacted) |
| `previous_campaign_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the previous campaign |
| `previous_outcome` | `boolean` | Outcome of the previous campaign |
| `campaign_outcome` | `boolean` | Outcome of the current campaign |
| `last_contact_date` | `date` | Last date the client was contacted |

## economics

| column | data type | description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `client_id` | `serial` | Client ID - references `id` in the `client` table |
| `emp_var_rate` | `float` | Employment variation rate (quarterly indicator) |
| `cons_price_idx` | `float` | Consumer price index (monthly indicator) |
| `euribor_three_months` | `float` | Euro Interbank Offered Rate (euribor) three month rate (daily indicator) |
| `number_employed` | `float` | Number of employees (quarterly indicator)|
